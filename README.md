===================

The code examples and topics in this handbook are gathered from various sources to give (or learn) TypeScript in more detail.

Glossary:
------
- tsc = TypeScript
- TS = TypeScript
- WBAS = will be added soon (as I progress with my learning goals)

What is TypeScript?

From their official website:

`TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.`

Why am I learning it?

I will be honest here, someone asked me how much do you know about TypeScript, and I said enough to work with it (and this was my mistake :) ).

Then he asked me few things related to TS and MAN!!!! he actually made me realize that I am no where near a person who can utilize this amazing tech and develop super amazing stuff.
